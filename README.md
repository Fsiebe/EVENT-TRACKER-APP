# EVENT-TRACKER-APP

The goal of the mobile app I developed was to create an event tracking system that allows users to view and manage upcoming events efficiently. This app was designed to address the need for quick access to event details, clear organization, and SMS notifications for reminders. To meet these needs, I created several user-centered screens, including a login page, an event listing screen using a data grid, and a detailed event view screen. The UI design followed Material Design principles and focused on simplicity and clarity, making the app intuitive and easy to navigate. When it came to coding the app, I used Android Studio and applied modular coding strategies, separating concerns using Room Database for data storage and keeping UI logic clean. This made it easier to troubleshoot and build functionality step-by-step. Testing was done continuously using the Android Emulator, allowing me to catch errors early and ensure features like login verification and data storage worked as expected. This testing process was crucialâ€”it revealed minor bugs and allowed for smoother user interactions. One challenge I faced was integrating the Room database with live UI updates, but I overcame it by using LiveData and ViewModel components to ensure data consistency. I feel I was especially successful in implementing the event storage and retrieval system, which clearly demonstrated my ability to manage local data and structure an efficient, user-friendly experience.
